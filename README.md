# Hel Package Manager Â· [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hel-repo/hpm.svg?branch=moon)](https://travis-ci.org/hel-repo/hpm)

Command-line package manager for OpenOS (OpenComputers).

Allows to easily download and install programs from [Hel Repository](https://github.com/hel-repo/hel).

OpenPrograms module is bundled with the program by default, making `oppm` unnecessary anymore.

Also you can define your own way of package distribution by writing custom hpm modules.
